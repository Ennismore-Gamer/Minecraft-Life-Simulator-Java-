This includes the following features:
1. Aging System
Players age over time as they progress through the game world. Their age increases each in-game day or after certain intervals.
The player receives messages in the chat displaying their current age as they get older.
Aging can also affect other gameplay aspects like health or appearance (if further developed).
2. Marriage System
Players can get married by interacting with another player. Once married, they are linked as spouses.
The marriage status can be toggled through a command, and players can "divorce" if they choose.
Marriage could affect gameplay in various ways, such as shared resources, buffs, or special interactions.
3. Health Over Time
Players' health can decline over time unless they take care of themselves (e.g., through food, medicine, or potions).
The health decline could be influenced by in-game actions like hunger, injuries, or lack of rest.
Health might also be tied to ageâ€”older players might experience health problems faster unless managed.
4. Player Interaction
The mod allows for deeper player interaction, especially with marriage and health.
Players can "marry" each other, forming relationships that might provide benefits, such as shared inventory or buffs.
Marital status and aging are displayed to players, giving them a more immersive experience.
5. Children System (Optional)
(Future Feature) Once married, players could have children. The children might grow over time, and players can take care of them.
Children could affect the player's life in various ways, including adding responsibilities or providing help.
6. Progression and Milestones
Age progression can have milestones, like coming of age, retirement, or other life events that affect the player's gameplay.
Players may unlock new abilities, traits, or quests as they age and experience life events.
7. Life Simulation Customization (Optional)
The mod could allow customization for various life events, aging speed, health effects, or how players interact with others (e.g., creating a family, working in a job, etc.).
Players may be able to modify the rates of aging, health decline, or marriage conditions through a configuration file or in-game settings.
NOTE -- This has not been tested. I recommend making a backup of your game.
